# google-homepage
For this project, I am going to replicate Google's homepage. Using the HTML/CSS skills that I have learned following the course on "the odin project", I will try to replicate the appearance of the website.

Project is finally up. Got some pretty decent help with google, web dev tools, and some of the student solutions. Will definitely need to do a couple more projects like this to get very familiar with it. The mock google site still needs work especially the footbar's styling. Hoping I could come back and fix it in the near future. Confusing and almost a frustrating, though small, it was still very satisfying.
